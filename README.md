ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jaesang Oh

Iâ€™m a Computer Science student at Georgia Tech with a strong passion for cybersecurityâ€”particularly threat intelligence, detection engineering, and network security.

I enjoy building projects that simulate real-world attacks, analyze adversary behavior, and explore how technology can be used for proactive defense.
